# Exploratory Statistical Analysis on Royal Canadian Yacht Club Dataset
Class Project for Introduction to Statistical Reasoning and Data Science


• Background: We will work with a dataset of 1000 randomly selected RCYC
members. The variables in the dataset contain basic information of the
members and their RCYC facilities usages. The variables have been jittered
(i.e. random noise has been added to them) to anonymize the data. This
project aims to identify patterns of how RCYC members use their facilities.

• Outline: First, we will use randomization test to study the difference in
median dining spendings between RCYC members who rented a dock and
those who did not. Then, we will use linear regression to study the
association between RCYC members’ spendings at RCYC bars and at
RCYC restaurants. Finally, we will use classification tree to predict whether
a member used RCYC fitness facilities based on his/her sex and other
spendings at RCYC facilities (not counting restaurants and bars)
